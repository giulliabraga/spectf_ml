# IN1102 Machine Learning

This repository was created for the machine learning course, which is part of the Computer Science postgraduate program at CIn/UFPE. It contains projects focused on training, evaluating and comparing various classifiers.

## Description

The projects in this repository use three datasets from the UCI Machine Learning dataset called "SPECTF Heart".  

Two different approaches were taken:

1. Application of two gaussian kernel fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms: KFCM-K e KFCM-K-W.1. The article named "Gaussian kernel fuzzy c-means with width parameter computation and regularization", available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320323004478, details these algorithms. The steps taken were:
 * .

2. Execution of a stratified 30 Ã— 10-folds cross-validation to compare four different classifiers: Gaussian Bayesian, k-nearest neighbor-based Bayesian, Parzen window-based Bayesian, and logistic regression classifiers. The steps taken were:
 *
